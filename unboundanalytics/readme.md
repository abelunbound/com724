# Project Name: Price forecasting for volatile digital assets

### About
This project aims to forecast prices over next 5-days for volatile digital assets 
like cryptocurrencies SOLigence, a Â£100billion pound investment firm. It consists of modules for:  
1. [x] Data pipeline _(with an API, a failover to Cloud SQL database & local data source for historical pricing data)_
2. [ ] Data quality tests
3. [ ] Data understanding
4. [ ] Data preprocessing
5. [ ] Feature selection
6. [ ] Analytical model
7. [ ] Model evaluation 

### Dependencies
Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to automatically generate a file that contains all 
libraries and their dependencies needed for the Python code to work. 
This is  useful when the codebase has several dependencies with different
versions and there is a need to run the Python code on a new system or environment.

Use `pip install - r requirements.txt` to automatically install multiple dependencies 
at the same time; this is less time consuming than installing one after the other from
the Python interpreter.
